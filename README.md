### Tic Tac Boi

**Description:**
Tic Tac Boi is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Python and Pygame. This project serves as an introduction to game development with Pygame, showcasing how to handle basic game mechanics, graphical display, and event management. The game features a graphical interface where two players can play the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

**Features:**
- Interactive graphical interface
- Two-player gameplay
- Real-time game updates
- Basic event handling

**Installation:**
To run Tic Tac Boi, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using pip:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

**Usage:**
Clone the repository and run the game script to start playing.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-boi.git
cd tic-tac-boi
python tic_tac_boi.py
```

**Code Example:**
Here's a basic setup for the Pygame window, demonstrating how to initialize Pygame, create a window, and handle the quit event:
```python
import pygame, sys
from pygame.locals import QUIT

pygame.init()
DISPLAYSURF = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))
pygame.display.set_caption('Hello World!')
while True:
   for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type == QUIT:
           pygame.quit()
           sys.exit()
   pygame.display.update()
```

This is a starting point for building the Tic Tac Toe game. Further development will include drawing the game grid, handling player inputs, checking for game wins, and updating the game state accordingly.
